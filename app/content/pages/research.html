		<h1>Making uncertainties visible: New approaches to uncertainty visualization</h1>
		<p> Our research project focuses on improving communication of scientific uncertainties associated with earth and environmental data, models and predictions. We do this by applying different methods to sample datasets to quantify uncertainties. We then compare, evaluate and improve these methods for communication with experts and non-experts using different approaches such as eye-tracking, decision-making tasks and survey questionnaires. The knowledge gained will be used in the development of a learning module on the topic of scientific uncertainty for teaching at universities. This project was awarded the <b>Dr. K.H. Eberle Prize</b> in 2024.<a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/aktuelles-und-publikationen/pressemitteilungen/newsfullview-pressemitteilungen/article/unsicherheiten-sichtbar-machen/">(Read more)</p>
