		<h1>Public Engagement & Outreach</h1>
		<p>Through outreach activities, we aim to raise awareness of the challenges of communicating scientific uncertainties to audiences with varying levels of scientific literacy  in order to promote a transparent dialogue between science and society. Some of our recent activities are highlighted below.</p>

			<li> Tübingen Science & Innovation Days 2024 <a href="https://www.sidays.com/">Read more</a>, We organized a series of activities and events as part of the Tübingen Science & Innovation Days 2024, which have the motto “Besser streiten” (argue better). The aim was to raise awareness of the challenges of visualizing uncertainties and promote a transparent dialogue between science and society. Activities included an interactive eye-tracking station, a World Cafe discussion depicting uncertainties in graphics, and a panel discussion exploring scientific data in everyday visual communication.<a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/securedl/sdl-eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3NjIyNjY2MDUsImV4cCI6MTc2MjM1NjYwNSwidXNlciI6MCwiZ3JvdXBzIjpbMCwtMV0sImZpbGUiOiJmaWxlYWRtaW4vVW5pX1R1ZWJpbmdlbi9EZXplcm5hdGUvRGV6ZXJuYXRfSUkvQWJ0ZWlsdW5nXzYvRG9rdW1lbnRlL1N0dWRpdW1fUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsZS9GbHllcl9VbnNpY2hlcmhlaXRlbl9TSURheXMyMDI0X0RyYWZ0LnBkZiIsInBhZ2UiOjI1ODIyMX0.Pu_52QGgq14P0Dg00BCsgJBzOwwHNZvNpyzGZnvY_Jk/Flyer_Unsicherheiten_SIDays2024_Draft.pdf">(Read more)</a></li>
